inkPot
	A pyQt based application to teach alphabets and its writing to children with learning diabilities. 
	The main window shown, is divided into two parts. Character select area & Write character area. Top shows the unicode characters in the selected language box. This part is updates when the language selection changes. 
	To start practicing  a character click/tap on the character. If we had already set the points, (numbered check points on the writing path) the character is displayed in the write character area below, also the character select part is also set hidden. If  the check points are not set already, a new dialog box appears, where we can set the needed points o preffered locations. Points can be added or removed before activating the 'ok' button.
	Now to start writing practice of the character, mouse press on the point indicating '0'/the blue colored point. The color of the next point turns blue indicating the path.If the writer, writes through the defined or set path set by the teacher, the smiling star appears as token of appreciation. If the writing path did not match the preffered path, crying star appears and we have to clear and start from the beginning.
	To delete a set point for a character, simply right click on the write character area.
